## Who am I ?

I am currently a Post-Doc at the University of Basel, Switzerland, in the [DMI-HPC](https://hpc.dmi.unibas.ch/) group led by [Florina Ciorba](https://hpc.dmi.unibas.ch/people/florina-ciorba/).

I am working on [DAPHNE](https://daphne-eu.eu/), an open and extensible system infrastructure for integrated data analysis pipelines combining data management and query processing, machine learning training and scoring, as well as high-performance computing and simulations.

Before December 2023 I was a PhD student at Université Grenoble Alpes under the supervision of [Eric Rutten](https://team.inria.fr/ctrl-a/members/eric-rutten/) and [Olivier Richard](https://datamove.imag.fr/olivier.richard/) working on the topic of  [“Control-based runtime management of HPC systems with support for reproducible experiments”](https://hal.science/tel-04389290)

You can find my CV [here]({{ site.url }}/downloads/CV_Guilloteau_Quentin_20241004.pdf}) (updated October 2024).
