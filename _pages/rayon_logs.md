# Internship: Rayon Logs

## Some info

### Dates

From June 4th 2018 to June 22nd 2018

### Location

Laboratoire d'Informatique de Grenoble [LIG](http://www.liglab.fr/en) (in Grenoble, France), with the [DATAMOVE team](https://www.liglab.fr/en/research/research-areas-and-teams/datamove)

### Mentor

[Frederic Wagner](http://www-id.imag.fr/Laboratoire/Membres/Wagner_Frederic/perso.html)


## Goal

The goal of this internship was to be able to visualize the execution of a parallel algorithm in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) that is using the [Rayon library](https://github.com/rayon-rs/rayon).

## Role

My role, during this internship, was to look at the [Rayon](https://github.com/rayon-rs/rayon) source code to understand the mechanisms of the library.

Then I needed to extract information (Working thread, execution time, ...) about each task created during a run of a parallel algorithm, to then display them in a understandable way.

## Results

This is the current version of the project: [rayon-logs](https://github.com/wagnerf42/rayon-logs)
